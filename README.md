## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

learn how to style a table and practice on using CSS variables

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  --section-radius: 13px;
  --paragraph-color: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
  --headers-font: "Young Serif", serif;
  --h2-color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
  --h2-size: 25px;
  --paragraph-size: 16px;
  --border-bottom: 1px solid hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
}
```


### Continued development

practice more on responsive layouts and using media queres
